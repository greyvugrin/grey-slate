# Grey Slate

A NodeJS multiplayer drawing experiment, using the Neighbor Points technique.

Check it out [here](https://enigmatic-garden-98307.herokuapp.com/).

## Getting started

You will need node to use this on your machine - get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). To install locally, download the repo, unzip it, and run `sudo npm install`. Then run it with `node app.js`. Open up a browser window and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will be able to draw by clicking and dragging. If you open other windows with the same URL and draw you will see the results across all of them.
